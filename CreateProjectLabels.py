# Filename: 		CreateProjectLabels.py
# Purpose: 			read through CSV export from OmniFocus and create the same Projects and Labels in Todoist 
# Input file: 		CSV-file export from OmniFocus in UTF-8.
# Important Note: 	OmniFocus needs to be exported in UTF-16 to keep important characters and line breaks.  To convert
#					UTF-16 to UTF-8, open the UTF-16 CSV in Sublime (for example) and "Save with Encoding" to UTF-8.
